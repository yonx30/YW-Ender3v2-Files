# Ikea-Lack-3D-Printer-Enclosure
Printable parts to construct a standard I3 style 3D printer enclosure using 2x Ikea Lacks

Lack enclosure remixed based on the Ender 3 V2 Ikea Lack 3D Printer Enclosure design by User moomoo124578 - Link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4873172

Uses 560mm x 465mm (22'' x 18.3'') 2mm thick acrylic panels for the sides, and 2 pieces of 280mm x 465mm (11'' x 18.3'') 3mm thick acrylic panels for the front doors. All other parts (eg. magnet holders, handles) are used as originally designed by moomoo124578 as above.

Printable legs have internal holes that are meant to house embedded M3 Hexagonal Nuts, to help screw the front panel hinges to the enclosure. When slicing the upper and lower legs, the print should be paused at the relevant heights (depending on the layer height used) to allow insertion of the nuts vertically into the print. The print will then bridge over then inserted nuts and embed them.
