### Lack Enclosure
Printable parts to construct a standard I3 style 3D printer enclosure using 2x Ikea Lacks

Lack enclosure remixed based on the Ender 3 V2 Ikea Lack 3D Printer Enclosure design by User moomoo124578 - Link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4873172

Uses 560mm x 465mm (22'' x 18.3'') 2mm thick acrylic panels for the sides, and 2x pieces of 280mm x 465mm (11'' x 18.3'') 3mm thick acrylic panels for the front doors. All other printed (eg. magnet holders, handles) and purchased parts (eg. screws, hinges) are used as originally uploaded by moomoo124578 as above.

Printable legs have internal holes that are meant to house embedded M3 Hexagonal Nuts, to help screw the front panel hinges to the enclosure. When slicing the upper and lower legs, the print should be paused at the relevant heights (depending on the layer height used) to allow insertion of the nuts vertically into the print. The print will then bridge over then inserted nuts and embed them. For the pictures below, a pause is inserted after Layer 279 is printed to slot the M3 nut into the highlighted hole.

### Motherboard Enclosure
Motherboard enclosure made using base dimensions from User GalvanicGlaze's enclosure - Link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4742032\ 

Uses 3x pieces of 20mm x 10mm x 2mm neodynium magnets to hold the cover shut, and these 2x 1.5in door hinges (Link - https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832452494262.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.80.3cec1802Jn35HK&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt), along with 2x M3x8 screws and 2x M3 nuts.

### MiniMe Hotend Remix
Remixed User P_design's 5015 MiniMe model - Link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4375296
Allows removal of the duct portion without needing to remove the hotend fan, providing easier access to the hotend (eg. for nozzle changes). Requires M3 hexagonal nuts to be embedded into duct after printing.


## Ender 3v2 Jyers Firmware
